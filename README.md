# Restaurant Tracker App
## Description:
This application is meant to be a demonstration of the skills I have learned so far in my programming course. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database, Ruby on Rails backend, and the React framework for the frontend. My focus on this application was the functionality between the back and front ends, without a heavy focus on the front/styling.

| Ruby | 2.7.4 |
| PostgreSQL | 14.1 |
